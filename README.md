#### Functionality

The dashboard provides insights into the number of patients visiting the emergency room based on:

*a. Timeframe*

- Total number of patients up-to-date
-	Total patients by year or month
-	Total patients visiting during mornings or afternoons
-	Total patients visiting during weekdays or weekends

*b. Demographics*

-	Breakdown of patients by gender
-	Total patients by age group
-	Total patients by race

*c. Category*

-	Total patients by department referral
-	Percentage of referred and walk-in patients
-	Percentage of patients by administrative and non-administrative appointments

The dashboard also includes:

- *Average Waiting Time*: Based on the selected filters.
-	*Average Satisfaction Rate*: Based on responses to the satisfaction survey, with the percentage of completed surveys shown as ‘service rated’.

Both the average waiting time and satisfaction rate can be filtered by age group and patient race.
